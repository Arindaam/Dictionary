This folder contains C Programs that were written to aid the modern day Pharmacy. It is a First Year BTech Mini-Project that intends to achieve to following aims:

1) The symptoms of the patient are input into the program which gives out the probable disease and the medicines. This puts in a safe system by which the pharmacists could give out medicines for minor health issues.

2) It also stores information about the medicines in the pharmacy with basic functionality which enables you to get information, buy and add medicines to the store.

3) It also deletes all the expired medicines automatically from the store.

Implementation details:

1) Diseases.c - This C Program enables you to add symptoms,diseases and probable medicines to the info.dat file.
2) info.dat - This file contains all the details of symptoms,diseases and probable medicines.
3) Pharmacy.c - This C Program has all the above mentioned functionality.
4) med.dat - This file contains the medicines and all of their information.

Scope for Improvement:

1) A better way to update the medicines database and also delete medicines from it. Currently we write the entire file into a new file, delete the old file and rename the new file.  

2) Add more diseases, symptoms the info.dat

3) Add a GUI for the Program.

Feel free to suggest any other changes you would want to make.
